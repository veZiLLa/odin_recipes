    <h2>The best boiled Eggs!</h2>
    <p>These Instant Pot hard-boiled eggs turn out perfect every time for me! The whites are cooked perfectly and the yolks are hard without being chalky. If you chill the eggs in cold water after pressure cooking them, they peel easily.

    <h2>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>16 large eggs</li>
 

    <h2><strong>Instructions</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Insert a wire rack at the bottom of a multifunctional pressure cooker, such as an Instant Pot. Pour in water. Carefully place raw eggs onto the rack, tightly fitting them in. Close and lock the lid.  </li>
        <li>Select High pressure, according to the manufacturer's instructions; set a timer for 4 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.  </li>
        <li>As soon as the timer goes off, hit cancel and release pressure using the quick-release method, according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid, as leaving eggs in longer will overcook them.</li>
        <li>Transfer eggs to a large bowl using a serving spoon and cover with cold water. Let cool for 5 minutes. Peel while still warm and rinse off any shell pieces. Use immediately or store in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
